# 🏥 Healthcare Dashboard

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Healthcare Dashboard** is a data-driven visualization tool designed to analyze and present key healthcare metrics. Built using **Power BI**, this dashboard helps stakeholders track patient data, hospital performance, and critical healthcare indicators.

## 🎯 Purpose
The goal of this dashboard is to provide actionable insights into healthcare operations, patient trends, and resource utilization. It helps healthcare administrators, doctors, and analysts make data-driven decisions to improve patient care and hospital efficiency.

## 🔑 Key Features
✅ **Patient Analytics**: Visualizes patient admissions, discharges, and demographics.  
✅ **Hospital Performance Metrics**: Tracks bed occupancy rates, treatment success rates, and staff efficiency.  
✅ **Financial Insights**: Displays revenue, operational costs, and insurance claims.  
✅ **Disease & Treatment Trends**: Highlights common diagnoses, treatment effectiveness, and medical procedures.  
✅ **Interactive Filters**: Enables users to drill down into specific time periods, departments, or patient groups.  
✅ **Real-time Data Refresh** (if connected to a live data source).  

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Power BI** (Primary visualization tool)  
- **SQL Database** (for structured data storage, if applicable)  
- **Excel/CSV** (for importing static datasets)  
- **APIs** (if real-time data is fetched from hospital systems)  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. **Open the Dashboard**: Load the `DashBoard.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.  
2. **Connect to Data**: Ensure the data sources (Excel, SQL, or API) are correctly linked.  
3. **Explore Insights**: Use the interactive charts and filters to analyze the data.  
4. **Publish & Share**: If needed, publish it to Power BI Service for cloud access.
